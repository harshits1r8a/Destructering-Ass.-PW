const str = "You are building a word count generator that will take a large string of text as input and output the words andthe number of times they are present in the string. Your task is to write a function that can count theoccurrences of each word in the string and return a Map containing each word's count. For simplicity, you can assume that the string only contains alphabetic characters and spaces."
